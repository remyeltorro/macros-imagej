# An ImageJ macro repository

In this repository, you will find a selection of ImageJ macros I wrote for collegues during my Ph.D. contract at Laboratoire AdhÃ©sion & Inflammation, Marseille. 

To use one such macro:
1) open Fiji
2) go to `Plugins > Macros > Startup Macros...`
3) copy and past (or load) the macro you selected and press `Run`

Some macros start with a file dialog window, some with a mini GUI and some require you to modify the script directly to fit your need.
